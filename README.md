- 👋 Hi, I’m @OleButterScotch
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge by exploring all avenues of the tech world. I am still new to all of this, and have yet to find a niche.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build my tech presence. My goal is to create an online resume of skills to hopefully get a career. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I am open to feedback and shared experiences.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am currently in the process of starting a website. I will update the information when I am complete.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I have 2 kids, currently going back to school, and working 12-hr rotating shifts. I spend most of my time trying to learn new projects to upgrade my tech skills. If I have free time, I spend it with my family.
